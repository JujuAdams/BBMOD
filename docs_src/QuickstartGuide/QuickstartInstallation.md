# Installation
If you have downloaded BBMOD from the
[YoYo Games Marketplace](https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/assets/9424/bbmod),
you can add it to your project by navigating to `Marketplace` > `My Library`,
selecting BBMOD and then clicking the import button.

If you have downloaded BBMOD from
[GitHub](https://github.com/blueburncz/BBMOD/releases), you have to navigate to
`Tools` > `Import Local Package` and then select the package from your computer.

When importing the package, you can see that BBMOD consists of multiple
folders - modules. Each one of the modules adds extra functionality, but the
only module you need to import to be able to use BBMOD is the
[Core module](./CoreModule.html). If you would like to learn more about modules,
see the [Modules](./Modules.html) section.
